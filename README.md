# README

This is a project to make an online Recipe Box using Ruby on Rails.

Users can create recipes that include mutiple ingredients and directions for each one.

I made this project because I wanted to learn:
  - how to duplicate my rails_recipe_box_HAML but using ERB (Embedded Ruby)
  - adding forms using the gem Simple_form
  - how to make nested forms using the gem Cocoon
  - enabling image uploading for users using the gem Paperclip
  - using the gem Devise for user sign up and login

Stack
  - Ruby version: 2.2.1
  - Rails version: 4.2.4
  - Database: SQLite
  - Frontend: Bootstrap
  - ERB markup language
